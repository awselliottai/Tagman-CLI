## **Getting Started**

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tagman-CLI.git
   cd Tagman-CLI
   ```
   
2. Install the script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x tagman
    mv tagman ~/.local/bin/
    ```
3. Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Add this to you `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` if needed:
    ```bash
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
    ```
    
4. Reload your shell:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
5. Run the program:
    ```bash
    tagman
    ```

## **Usage**
### **Main Menu**

Tagman CLI starts with a simple menu:
  ```bash
  -----------------
  Tagman CLI 3.Woah
  -----------------
  Choose an option:
  1. Tag a file or directory
  2. Search for a file or directory by tag
  3. List current directory tags
  4. Exit
  ```

1. **Tag a File or Directory:** Assign one or more tags to a file or directory.
2. **Search by Tag:** Find files or directories by their assigned tags.
3. **List Current Directory Tags:** View tags assigned to the current working directory.
4. **Exit:** Leave the program.


## Examples

1. **Tagging the Current Directory**
  ```bash
  Tag the current directory? (y/n): y
  Enter tags (comma-separated): project, important, notes
  Tags updated for /home/user/my-project: project, important, notes
  ```

2. **Searching for Tags**

    ```bash
    Enter tag to search: important
    Searching for tag 'important'
    Results:
    /home/user/my-project
    ```
3. **Listing Current Directory Tags**

    ```bash
    Current tags for /home/user/my-project:
    project, important, notes
    ```
**How It Works**

- Tags Database: Stored in a lightweight file at `~/.tags.db`, making Tagman fast and portable.
- Bash-powered: Built entirely in Bash for simplicity and compatibility.
- Effortless Management: Minimalist input prompts ensure you‚Äôre always one step ahead of file chaos.

**Peace be with you, starlight.**
